I have generated a Netflix Clone website with outstanding design. (React + Vite)
With categorized movies, it is easier to find the movie you want. When you click on the movies' posters you can have the information about the movie's category, spoken languages, production companies, production countries, overview, budget, revenue and cast.

Enjoy your movie!
